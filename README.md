This software package detects shadows from single images by using an 
approach described in the following paper:

J.-F. Lalonde, A. A. Efros, and S. G. Narasimhan. Detecting Ground Shadows 
in Outdoor Consumer Photographs. in European Conference on Computer Vision, 
2010.

Please cite this paper if you use this code in your work. See 
'demoShadowDetection.m' as a starting point on how to use the software.


Changing the input image
========================

If you want to make it work on your own image, here's what you should do:

1.  Copy your image in the img/ directory (should have .jpg extension);
2.  Change the imgName variable with the new filename (leave the .jpg extension out);
3.  If you want to detect shadows on the ground only:

    3.1  Compute the ground probability map (e.g. with Geometric Context, see below);
    3.2  Save the ground probability map as variable 'groundProb' in a .mat file;
    3.1  Copy the .mat file containing the variable 'groundProb' in the img/ directory;
    3.2  Rename the file to '<image name as in step 2>-groundProb.mat'.

4. Watch the output while the program is running to make sure there are no errors or warnings;
5. That's it!

News
====

-  10/03/2012: Code is now on github.  
-  05/24/2011: The code should now work without requiring the Matlab 
   Statistics Toolbox (thanks to M. Chen for helping me figure this out!). 
   It's best to re-download the code completely. The following changes have 
   been made:
   -  The 'data/bdt-eccv10.mat' file has been changed to use built-in 'structs' 
      instead of 'classtreereg'.
   -  The 'skewness.m' function has been added to replace the toolbox's. 


Requirements
============

Required 3rd-party software **not included** in this package
--------------------------------------------------------

*  [Lightspeed matlab toolbox](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/) by Tom Minka, 
   need at least version 2.4.
*  [Graph cut wrapper](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bagon/matlab.html) by Shai Bagon
   which uses C++ code by Olga Veksler.
  
If you put these 3rd-party packages in a `pathUtils` folder in the same base
folder as the `shadowDetection`, they should be picked up automatically by
`setPath`. 


Required 3rd-party software **included** in this package
------------------------------------------------------

In addition, this code uses the following freely-available matlab code: 

*   [Bilateral filtering](http://mesh.brown.edu/dlanman) by Douglas R. Lanman
*   [Boundary extraction](http://www.andrewstein.net/) from Andrew Stein
*   [Fast nearest-neighbor search](http://www.advancedmcode.org/k-nearest-neigbours-search.html) by Luigi Giaccari,
    also available [here](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22407-k-nearest-neighbours-and-radius-range-search);
*   [Boosted decision tree](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/homes/dhoiem/) by Derek Hoiem
  
Compilation
-----------

Check within each of the following directories and make sure you compile 
the .mex files. They are required for this software to run:

*   Boosted decision trees

        $ cd 3rd_party/boost
        $ mex treevalc.c

*   Nearest neighbor

        $ cd 3rd_party/nearestneighbor
        $ mex BruteSearchMex.cpp

Optional 3rd-party software **not included** in this package
--------------------------------------------------------

*   [Geometric context](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/homes/dhoiem/) by Derek Hoiem.
